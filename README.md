tracking repairs made to PCs in a shop environment

This is my ham fisted attempt at keeping track of my pc repairs within my company's maintenance section.  This is by no means 
meant to be a sophisticated 'do everything' tracker.

This app simply keeps a db record of incoming pcs, the problems and solutions as well as the external shops they come from
so as to allow me to give reports to my superiors concerning issues with repetitive problems and shops.
